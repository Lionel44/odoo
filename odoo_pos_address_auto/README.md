Pos Partner french address auto-completion
==========================================
In the form of creating partners, you have the autocompletion of the fields related to the postal address. This module is designed only for postal addresses in France and is based on the French government database address.data.gouv.fr

The search applies to postal codes, the city name but also the names of streets or places known as

For example by typing only "Moza 44130" in the Street field, the autocompletion will propose "Rue Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 44130 - Fay-de-Bretagne"
